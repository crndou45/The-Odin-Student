        <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li> <br>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li> <br>
        <li>3 cups whole milk</li> <br>
       <li>4 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li><br>
       <li>2 cups shredded Gruyère or Mozzarella cheese</li><br>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the fillings:</strong>
        <ul>
         <li><strong>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish and set aside.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Cook Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until it is al dente or one minute shy of the package directions (the pasta will finish cooking in the oven). Drain well and return to the pot.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Make the Roux: In a large saucepan or pot, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour, salt, and pepper, cooking and whisking constantly for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and bubbling.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Melt Cheese into Sauce: Remove the saucepan from the heat. Gradually stir in the shredded cheddar and Gruyère/Mozzarella cheeses until melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. Stir in the paprika if using. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Bake: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the cheese sauce is bubbly around the edges.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Serve: Let the mac and cheese rest for about 5-10 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to set. </strong></li>   
        </ul>
        </li> 
    
    </ol>
