        <li>4 tbsp sugar (adjust to preference)</li> <br>

            <strong>Prepare Amagwinya:</strong>
        <ul>
        <br> <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast (and powdered milk, if using) until well combined.
</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Allow to Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, and leave it in a warm place to rise for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Prepare for Frying: Punch the dough down gently after it has risen. On a lightly floured surface, shape the dough into small balls or flatten them slightly into discs.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Fry the Magwinya: Carefully drop dollops of the dough into the hot oil in small batches. Fry until they are golden brown on both sides, turning them over as needed. Do not overcrowd the pot.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Drain and Serve: Remove the cooked magwinya with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to drain any excess oil.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Enjoy: Serve the magwinya warm on their own or with a variety of fillings such as jam, honey, cheese, or savory mince.</strong></li>   
        </ul>
    </li>
