    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>30 ml (2 tbsp) sunflower oil</li> <br>

        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li> <br>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger paste (optional)</li> <br>
        <li>1 tbsp Rajah mild & spicy curry powder (or a similar curry powder)</li> <br>
        <li>1 tsp chicken spice mix (e.g., Robertsons chicken spice)</li> <br>
        <li>2 x 400g tins chopped and peeled tomatoes</li> <br>
        <li>500 ml (2 cups) water or chicken stock</li> <br>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li> <br>
        <li>1 packet brown onion soup powder (for thickening)</li> <br>
        <li>Fresh parsley or coriander, chopped, for garnish </li> <br>
     </ol> 

     
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Chicken</strong>
        <ul>
       <br>  <li><strong>Season and brown the chicken: Season the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, and the chicken spice mix. Heat the oil in a large pot or casserole dish over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and brown them on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Sauté aromatics: In the same pot, add the chopped onion and fry until soft. Add the garlic and ginger paste (if using) and the curry powder, frying for another minute until fragrant.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Cook the chicken and potatoes: Return the browned chicken to the pot. Add the potato chunks. Cover the pot and let it simmer gently for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are soft.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Thicken the gravy: If a thicker gravy is desired, mix the brown onion soup powder with a little cold water to form a smooth paste. Stir this into the stew and let it simmer for a further 5-10 minutes until the gravy has thickened.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Serve: Adjust seasoning if needed. Garnish with fresh parsley or coriander and serve hot with the pap. </strong></li>   
        </ul>
        </li>

               
        </li>
    </ol>      


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>4 cups water</li> <br>
        <li>2 cups maize meal</li> <br>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li> <br>
        <li>1 tbsp butter (optional, for creaminess)</li> <br>
       
     </ol> 


      <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Pap </strong>
        <ul>
        <br> <li><strong>Boil water: In a heavy-based pot, bring the water to a rolling boil and add the salt and butter (if using).</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Add maize meal: Gradually pour the maize meal into the boiling water, allowing it to form a mound in the center. Do not stir immediately.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Simmer and stir: Cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Stir well: Remove the lid and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or a fork to break up any lumps and incorporate the maize meal evenly. The mixture will be stiff.</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Steam: Cover the pot again and continue to cook on low heat for another 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally (every few minutes) to ensure even cooking and prevent sticking</strong></li>   
         <br><li><strong>Fluff and serve: Once cooked and firm, fluff the pap with a fork before serving it alongside your chicken stew.</strong></li>   
        </ul>
        </li>
